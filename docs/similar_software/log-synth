log-synth is a data generator that aims to generate realistic data based on predefined schemas.

Could it fill the role of Ductus?
 Answer: No
 1.It is oriented towards generating server log files, so it's not ideal for generating sensor data, plus even if it could, each log is generated individually,
 so we couldn't simulate corelations between different sensors.
